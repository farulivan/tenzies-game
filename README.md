# Tenzies
An online-digital remake of Tenz game.

## What is Tenzi
> "TENZI is the worldâ€™s fastest dice game! Fast, fun, and engaging, TENZI is perfect for table top beginners and aficionados alike. Every player gets 10 dice. The object of the game is to roll the dice as fast as possible, the player who gets all dice on the same number and yells "TENZI!" is the winner." - Amazon

This remake can be played by only one person on each device. You can play with the others using other devices, or you can play like in "time-trial" mode, and record it with a stopwatch. Have fun! TENZI!
