# Tenzies Game
An online-digital remake of Tenzi game. This 'Tenzies Game' is one of the latest project that I did when I learn React from React Course (Scrimba) by Bob Ziroll (Head of Education at Scrimba).

## What is Tenzi?
> "TENZI is the worldâ€™s fastest dice game! Fast, fun, and engaging, TENZI is perfect for table top beginners and aficionados alike. Every player gets 10 dice. The object of the game is to roll the dice as fast as possible, the player who gets all dice on the same number and yells "TENZI!" is the winner." - Amazon
