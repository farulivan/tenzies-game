# Tenzies Game
An online-digital remake of Tenzi game. This 'Tenzies Game' is one of the latest project that I did when I learn React from React Course (Scrimba) by Bob Ziroll (Head of Education at Scrimba).

## What is Tenzi?
> "TENZI is the worldâ€™s fastest dice game! Fast, fun, and engaging, TENZI is perfect for table top beginners and aficionados alike. Every player gets 10 dice. The object of the game is to roll the dice as fast as possible, the player who gets all dice on the same number and yells "TENZI!" is the winner." - Amazon

## Overview
This remake can be played by only one person on each device. You also can play with the others using other devices, or you can play like in "time-trial" mode, and record it with your own stopwatch. Have fun! TENZI!

## Features
- Hold a dice/number that choose by the user and roll the others when user push a roll button
- End the game when user completely get all the same dice/number. Digital confetti will be start. The roll button change into new game button to play again.
